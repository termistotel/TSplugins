[i][u]Using the old discipline known as "the arhaology", we managed to dig up and find an old contraption, class: [i]RADIO STATION[/i]. This tech was a main source of culture enrichment and information relaying a few generations ago. This is the first radio station class artefact we managed to find in a working condition, so it was of outmost importance to utilise it as soon as we could.[/i][/u] 


[b]Hallowed Catharina[/b],

It is my joyful duty to report that, in only a few months, we have succeded with our great mission. We are now in possession of another gem of knowledge that was forgotten, but found, and brought to work again. 
This is the greatest proof of justness of our cause. Obviously, U§i°˛d``&rth co. [i]United Earth co.[/i] and their precious palvers will never accept this, but if put neatly, this knowledge could increase the value of the Resistance Against Earth and spread our influence to the known realm (once we are ready ofcourse). 

To you, our founder and our strongest personality, I shall present the information our rats could induce on the inner workings of the contraption:

[b]T-Rat report:[/b]
Writen on it's casing, we have found a quasi-definition of [url=babura.tk]Babura[/url]. Preliminary tests could not conclude that the contraption itself is directly related to this mythical Babura, but some of our best men are still [i]thinking[/i] through the subject (Although they are yet to produce a paper of worth). In my opinious thought, it is more probable that the contraption was originaly named in honor of this mythical Babura. In that light, we have decided to name it Radio Babura.
[color=darkgreen][<s>>[/color] Side note: The Babura itself is still a big unknown to us, so no thoughts could be produced on the subject. [color=darkgreen]<<s>][/color]

[b]L-Rat report:[/b]
Last week, one of our rats, Pakhor, found out that antennas and radiation detectors from salvaged ships respond to the contraption's activation. Since that day, we have managed to build full-on devices that tap into information which flows out of the radio station. And, as suspected, by interfacing it with crew-speaking device, we can get koherent sounds which we'll leave to our T-team to analyse.
On the topic of inner workings:
Contraption seems to create information particles that travel through the hypothetical aether. They seem to move at very high (or infinite) speed, since our detectors immediately respond to the contraption's activation no matter the distance. If this theory is proven correct, it could give the foundation needed for producing our own ship drives for space travel.
